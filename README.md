we used CNN based end-to-end model on **CIFAR10 dataset**.
Using **cutout augmentation** for improved classification accuracy and **LR finder** to find the best learning rate.
Towards the end, using **grad-CAM** we could see **25 misclssified images** and reason why they were misclassified. The focus of grad-CAM is not on the object of the image, but on other regions of the image.
